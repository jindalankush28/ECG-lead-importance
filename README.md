Lead importance in 12-lead ECG

Project proposed for graduate level class: Machine Learning for Medical Application `ML4MA_project.pdf`

## Project Overview
This project investigates the relative importance of each lead in a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) for diagnosing cardiac conditions. By optimizing lead selection, we aim to improve the efficiency and accessibility of ECG diagnostics, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

## Objectives
- Train models to predict cardiac conditions using a reduced number of ECG leads.
- Evaluate the diagnostic value of each lead using Shapley values.
- Validate models on external datasets to ensure generalizability.

---

## Motivation
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. While 12-lead ECGs are valuable diagnostic tools, their complexity may limit accessibility. Reducing the number of required leads can:
- Lower costs
- Improve accessibility in underserved areas
- Enhance patient comfort
- Expedite diagnosis without compromising accuracy

---

## Significance
- **Cost-Effective Diagnosis:** Streamlines workflows and reduces financial burden.
- **Time Efficiency:** Accelerates clinical decision-making.
- **Accessibility:** Enables diagnostics in remote or resource-poor settings.
- **Personalized Care:** Facilitates tailored diagnostic approaches.
- **Advancing Knowledge:** Contributes to ECG analysis methodologies and clinical best practices.

### Shapley Value Approximation
- Monte Carlo sampling approach to estimate the contribution of each lead.
- Enables efficient evaluation without exhaustive computation of all lead combinations.
